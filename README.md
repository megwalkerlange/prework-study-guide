# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

The aim of this project was to create a study guide so that a bootcamp student can make and store notes. The page contains seperate sections to record notes about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. I began ot learn the basic rules of these languages during this project and was able to begin start learning how to push code to GitHub, use repositories and project branches.
